# My Project

  In this project we proficiently utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Pymatgen for data
manipulation, analysis and visualization. The project involved pre-processing XRD data, identifying
crystallographic peaks using peak-finding algorithms, determining crystal structures, d-spacing of Zn Nano powder.
Successfully extracted lattice parameters and other crystallographic information. The project not only demonstrated
Python programming and pymatgen library but also showcased a deep understanding of XRD techniques and
material science principles, providing valuable insights into the crystallographic properties of materials.

- ## XRD Data Of Zn Nano-Powder
  Using pandas library we loaded the our data.csv file which containes numeric data for theta and intensity parameters which required to plot XRD pattern.

- ## Plot Of XRD Pattern
  Here, we identified the peaks and mark them with * so we can easily identify peaks from the graph which is above the given set values for height and from that get effecient and accurate values for the further calculations.
