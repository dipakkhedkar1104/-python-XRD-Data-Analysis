# My Project

  In this project we proficiently utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Pymatgen for data
manipulation, analysis and visualization. The project involved pre-processing XRD data, identifying
crystallographic peaks using peak-finding algorithms, determining crystal structures, d-spacing of Zn Nano powder.
Successfully extracted lattice parameters and other crystallographic information. The project not only demonstrated
Python programming and pymatgen library but also showcased a deep understanding of XRD techniques and
material science principles, providing valuable insights into the crystallographic properties of materials.
